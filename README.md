# Librarian

This React application utilizes the Google Books API to search their available books and allow you to save your favorites. The search engine gives you a card with the title, author, description, cover, and a link to purchase/download the book. Users use the search engine to find books while logged out. Once they create an account, they can save their favorites and view them all in one page.
